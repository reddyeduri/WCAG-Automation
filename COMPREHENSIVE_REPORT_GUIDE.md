## 📊 Understanding Your Compliance Level

### **Level A (Minimum)**
- 30 criteria total
- Must pass ALL to claim Level A compliance
- Check Sheet 5 for status

### **Level AA (Standard)**
- 50 criteria total (A + AA)
- Required for most legal compliance
- Check Sheet 6 for status

### **Level AAA (Enhanced)**
- 78 criteria total (A + AA + AAA)
- Beyond legal requirements
- Check Sheet 7 for status

## ✅ Sample Report Interpretation

If your report shows:

```
Executive Summary:
- Total Criteria: 78
- Passed: 26
- Failed: 3
- Manual Required: 12
- Not Tested: 37

Level A: 21/30 passed (70%)
Level AA: 14/20 passed (70%)
```

**This means:**
- ✅ 26 criteria automatically tested and passed
- ❌ 3 criteria failed (FIX THESE FIRST!)
- ⚑ 12 criteria need manual testing
- ○ 37 criteria not covered by automation

**Action:**
1. Fix the 3 failures
2. Manually test the 12 flagged items
3. Review the 37 "Not Tested" to see if applicable
4. Target 100% pass rate for Level A and AA

---

## 🔍 Finding Specific WCAG Criteria

**In Sheet 2 (All WCAG Criteria):**

1. Press `Ctrl+F` to search
2. Search for WCAG ID (e.g., "1.4.3")
3. See status immediately

**Or use filters:**
1. Click header row
2. Data → Filter
3. Filter by Level, Status, or Principle

---

## 📝 Notes on "Not Tested" Criteria

Some criteria show "Not Tested" because:

1. **Can't be automated** (e.g., reading level, caption quality)
2. **Not implemented yet** (e.g., reflow testing, orientation)
3. **May not apply** (e.g., sign language if no audio)

**Review each "Not Tested" to determine:**
- Does it apply to your site?
- Do you need to manually test it?
- Should you mark it as "Not Applicable"?

---

## 🎓 Pro Tips

1. **Focus on Level A and AA first** - Filter Sheet 2 to show only A and AA
2. **Fix critical issues first** - Go to Sheet 8, sort by Severity
3. **Track over time** - Save reports with dates, compare improvements
4. **Use manual flags** - Sheet 4 is your manual testing checklist
5. **Share with team** - Excel format is easy to share and discuss
